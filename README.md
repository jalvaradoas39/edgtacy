# Edgtacy

[Edgtacy](https://edgtacy.com/) is a website that was originally created to offer professional photo enhancement services. The site demonstrated techniques such as blemish removal, stray hair removal, wrinkle reduction, red-eye correction, and more.

Although the website is still online, it is no longer fully functional as I no longer provide the business. It remains accessible as an example of how the site looked like when it was fully functional, showcasing features such as add-to-cart functionality, a cart page, and a payment checkout integration using Authorize.net API.
